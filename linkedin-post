📷 Automating Instagram Posts with Python 🚀  

Ever wondered if you could publish an **Instagram post directly from your terminal**?  
This week, I explored the **Instagram Graph API** and built a Python script to do just that.  

🔹 Steps I followed:  
1️⃣ Generated a long-lived access token from the Meta Developer App  
2️⃣ Collected my Instagram Business Account ID  
3️⃣ Wrote a Python script using `requests` to upload an image + caption  
4️⃣ Published it directly from Linux terminal  

⚙️ Run it like this:
source load_env.sh
python3 post_instagram.py  

✅ Result: My image + caption was instantly live on Instagram!  

✨ Why this matters:  
- Social media automation saves time  
- Can auto-publish project updates or blogs  
- Shows the magic of **Python + APIs**  

👉 Question: Would you trust automation to handle your Instagram posts?
